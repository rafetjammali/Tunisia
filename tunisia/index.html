         <h3>Places</h3>
         <p>or those looking for an exotic, fun vacation that won’t break the bank, consider Tunisia. Tunisia is a beautiful country,
		 with a mediocre economy. This means that you can travel there and have a great vacation for much less money than you would
		 spend on a more popular vacation destination. </p>

         <h4>where is IT ? </h4>
         <p> is the northernmost country in Africa, at almost 165,000 square kilometres (64,000 sq mi) in area, the smallest country in the Maghreb region of North Africa.
		 It is bordered by Algeria to the west, Libya to the southeast and the Mediterranean Sea to the north and east. As of 2013, 
		 its population is estimated at just under 10.8 million.[5] Its name is derived from its capital city, Tunis, located on the country's northeast coast.</p>
         <p>Geographically, Tunisia contains the eastern end of the Atlas Mountains and the northern reaches of the Sahara desert. Much of the rest of the country's land is fertile soil. 
		 Its 1,300 kilometres (810 mi) of coastline includes the African conjunction of the western and eastern parts of the Mediterranean Basin and, by means of the Sicilian Strait and Sardinian Channel
		 , features the African mainland's second and third nearest points to Europe after Gibraltar.</p>
